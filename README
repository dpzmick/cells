This is a simple elementary cellular automata simulator.

Everything should be pretty self explanatory.

Requires either openmp or a compiler supporting cilk, or neither (I think).

You will probably need to modify the makefile to set up.

Note: OpenMP doesn't work with OS X supplied "gcc" (clang). To use OpenMP, you
will need to build a copy real gcc (Use homebrew)
